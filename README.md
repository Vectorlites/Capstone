# Capstone Project: NLP Vectorization And Hyperparameter Tuning

This capstone will build analytics models to characterize the COVID-19 outbreak. Initially collected the COVID data and implement the NLP (Natural Language Processing), Machine learning algorithms to build a model that can input any dataset and gives the characteristics of the data by performing the analysis.

We extracted information from the corona data sources starting with standard techniques like bag of words concept, vectorisation techniques and document similarity scores then computed compressed vectors created by encoders to create the abstract of any dataset. This can be used in decreasing the defects and increasing the code quality in the data pipelines.

Objective - Created an abstract model that converts any input string into a vector
Goal - Applied hyperparemeter tuning Methods to optimize the model
